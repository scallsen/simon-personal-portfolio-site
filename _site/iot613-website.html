      <h1>IoT613 Web Refresh</h1>
      <p>Over the period of 14 weeks, I worked with a small team of UX/UI designers to produce a new website for the IoT613 Conference, which will take place at the Canadian Museum of History early 2018.</p>

      <h2 class="bold">The Project</h2>
      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>The client we worked with was Robert Decher, Marketing Communications Advisor at Accurate Creative. We were tasked with refreshing the existing IoT613 website.</p>
      <p>After analyzing the flow of the existing site, we found that there needed to be some minor optimization to content organization, but larger changes to the design and layout of the site.</p>
      <h3>Ideation and Wireframes</h3>
      <p>We developed three prototypes as a group, and later set out to find a theme that each could best align to each prototype. The prototypes had to be modified after, due to the limitations of each theme.</p>
      <p>We then presented our three options to Robert, and after deciding on the final concept (and making applicable changes), we were ready to start building our site.</p>
      <h3>Building a Working Prototype</h3>
      <p>We were provided space on the Accurate development server, and set up our Wordpress installation online.</p>
      <p>Content population proved to be a slight challenge, as details of the IoT613 2018 conference were still in preliminary stages. We used a mix of placeholder, provided, and 2017 content to populate modules on the website.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of line of custom CSS were added to add additonal functionality and customization that the original theme did not allow.</p>
      <div class="">
        <a class="btn micro gutter push-2" href="http://www.iot613.accuratedev.ca">TEMPORARY LINK TO PROTOTYPE</a>
      </div>
      <h3>Assets and Deliverables</h3>
      <p>We created three animated icons to serve as shortcuts on the main page to the three main functions of IoT613.</p>
      <img class="img-flex" src="images/portfolio-work/iot613/icon-gifs.gif" alt="">
      <h3>Logo Animation</h3>
      <p>Outside of the project, I created a logo animation for the IoT613 brand (added as GIF form as the site's logo). In addition to this, I used the three themes (Learn, Interact, Connect) I turned it into a sting that could be used for promotional material.</p>

      <h2 class="bold">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>I acted as the Team Lead for our group. This role meant that it was my responsibility to maintain effective communication between our team and the client, and our team and the instructor.</p>
      <p>The biggest takeaway from this project was setting realistic goals. It is important to assess your groups' potential and total amount of allotted time and set a realistic timeframe to ensure evertyhing can be completed on time.</p>
      <p>I can say that our team had no issues with time-management as we planned accordingly. Our website was handed off to the client with all of our goals accomplished on time by the end of the term.</p>
